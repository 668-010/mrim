	1. Installation

Note: I didn't test Mrim on Windows, because I don't have Windows
installed on my computer.

For *nix installations:
1) Make sure you have Python >= 2.3 installed.
2) Install xmpp.py library from http://xmpppy.sourceforge.net (you need at least version >= 3.1).
3) Download Mrim archive and decompress it:
	tar -xjvf mrim-x.y.tar.bz2
4) Enter to Mrim directory:
	cd mrim-x.y
5) Copy mrim.conf.example to mrim.conf:
	cp mrim.conf.example mrim.conf
6) Edit mrim.conf (see section 2 of this document).
7) Check access for
	a) mrim.mail.ru:2042
	b) mrimX.mail.ru:2041 (currently X = 1,...,31).
	c) avt.foto.mail.ru:80
	See section 4 of this document if you want to use proxies.
8) Check permissions on config file, log file and profiles directory.
9) Run Mrim:
	./mrim.sh -c mrim.conf
	For all command line options refer to section 3 of this document.



	2. Configuration file.

Configuration file has 'ini' syntax. New lines must NOT start with whitespace characters.
Line continuations are NOT supported. Comments are started with '#'.
There are three sections in config file: [main], [profile] and [logger].
Example config file is located in Mrim directory.

1) Section [main].
	name
		Required.
		Format: any_string
		DNS name of service. Your XMPP server must correctly resolves it.
	password
		Requried.
		Format: any_string
		Password for external components access.
		Refer to documentation of your XMPP server if you had not set it already.
	port
		Default is 5347.
		Format: any_integer
		Port that your XMPP server listens for external components.
		Refer to documentation of your XMPP server if you had not set it already.
	server
		Default is localhost.
		Format: dns name or ip address
		Target IP address or DNS name of your XMMP server.
	disconame
		Default is Mail.ru IM.
		Format: any_string
		Discovery name of Mrim service.
	reconnect
		Default is on.
		Format: on|off
		Automatically reconnects users after tcp session failure.
	probe
		Default is on.
		Format: on|off
		Send 'probe' stanzas to registered users on startup. That means service tries to
		connect all registered online users on startup.
	show_version
		Default is on.
		Format: on|off
		Shows service version through iq:version stanza.
	show_os
		Default is on.
		Format: on|off
		Shows server's operation system (on which mrim is running) through iq:version stanza.
	psyco
		Default is off.
		Format: on|off
		Psyco support (see http://psyco.sourceforge.net). Not well tested and hence NOT recommended.
	http_proxy
		By default, there is no http proxy server.
		Format: http://proxy.server:port
		HTTP proxy support for user avatars. See section 4 for details.
	admins
		By default, there are no admins.
		Format: jid1, jid2, ..., jidN
		JIDs of users with administrative permissions.
		Currently admins can see online users in Mrim's discovery items.
	pidfile
		By default, mrim doesn't create PID file.
		Format: /path/to/pid/file.
		Path to PID file. You can override this value by command line option (see section 3).

2) Section [profile]
	type
		Required.
		Format: xml.
		Type of users profiles. Currently only xml-like storage is available.
	dir
		Required.
		Format: /path/to/profile/dir
		Directory for storing users profiles.

3) Section [logger]
	logfile
		Requried.
		Format: /path/to/logfile
		Path to log file.
	loglevel
		Required.
		Format: debug|info|warning|error|critical
		The level of logging messages. Recommended level is 'info'.
		Use 'debug' level only if you've found a bug and want to investigate it before sending report.
	xml_formatting
		Default is off.
		Format: on|off.
		Use it only with 'debug' loglevel if you want pretty xml debugging with indentations.
		Warning: don't use this option in production systems! It eats a lot of resources!
	timestamp
		Default is %%d/%%m/%%y-%%H:%%M:%%S
		Format: formatted_string
		Format of timestamps in log messages. Every variables must starts with '%%'.
		For example, %%H means a hour, %%m means a month, etc.
		See the python library reference manual of 'time' module for available variables.



	3. Command line options.

Available command line options are:
	-h            brief help.
	-d            run in background, currently works only on *nix.
	-c filename   path to config file.
	-p filename   path to PID file.



	4. Proxy support.

Mrim tries to connect to
	a) mrim.mail.ru:2042
	b) mrimX.mail.ru:2041 (currently X = 1,...,31).
	c) avt.foto.mail.ru:80
However if you don't have direct access to any of this addresses you might want to use proxy servers.
Mrim gets user avatars from http://avt.foto.mail.ru. If you have available HTTP proxy server,
you have to use 'http_proxy' option in configuration file (see section 2.1).
Unfortunately, Mrim doesn't support SOCKS proxying natively. You may use transparent SOCKS proxying library though.
For example, Mrim is well tested with tsocks (http://tsocks.sourceforge.net).



	5. Hardware requirements.

Mrim consumes about 100kb of virtual memory per user.
